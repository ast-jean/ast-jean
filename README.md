## Introduction
Hello! My name is Adam, and I'm a student at 42Quebec. I'm an aspiring web developer with a strong passion for technology, creativity, and problem-solving. I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills in this ever-evolving industry. In this README, you'll find an overview of my background, my technical skills, and my professional goals. Let's get started!

## Background

I started my journey in web development at 42Quebec, a progressive programming school that offers a unique, project-based learning experience. At 42Quebec, I've had the opportunity to work on various challenging projects, collaborate with my peers, and develop essential problem-solving and teamwork skills.

Before joining 42Quebec, I had a background in customer service and industrial manufacturing. My diverse experiences have contributed to my growth as a developer and have given me a unique perspective on the world of technology.
## Technical Skills

Throughout my time at 42Quebec, I've become proficient in several programming languages, tools, and frameworks. Here's an overview of my technical skill set:

-Languages: C, C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
-Frameworks/Libraries: React, Angular, Vue.js, Django
-Version Control: Git and GitHub
-Other Tools: Node.js, Webpack, Bootstrap, and Docker

While these are my current skills, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and looking for ways to expand my expertise.
## Projects

I've had the privilege to work on several interesting projects during my time at 42Quebec. Here are a few highlights:

-[MiniRT](https://gitfront.io/r/ast-jean/mWxJc7eLbA3F/MiniRT/): The MiniRT project is a minimalist ray-tracing engine built using fixed-point arithmetic in C. This compact yet powerful engine renders 3D scenes with realistic lighting and shadows, while leveraging the precision and performance benefits of fixed-point number representation. Designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, MiniRT demonstrates the potential of ray-tracing techniques in resource-constrained environments, using the new updated Codam's version of the MLX42.
-[Minishell](https://gitfront.io/r/ast-jean/JbttmM2pLdyT/minishell/): Minishell is a lightweight, custom-built Unix shell implemented in C. It provides a minimalistic, user-friendly command-line interface, allowing users to execute common shell commands and navigate the file system. By implementing core shell functionalities from scratch, Minishell offers a unique opportunity to gain in-depth understanding of shell programming and Unix system calls. Perfect for educational purposes or as a foundation for more advanced shell projects, Minishell showcases the power of simplicity in a user-friendly package.
-[SoLong](): SoLong is a captivating 2D tile-based game developed in C, offering players an engaging, visually appealing experience in a customisable labyrinthine world. The project features smooth character movement, object interactions and animations all brought together by a minimalist graphical user interface. Using the MLX42 graphical library.

### Personal projects
- I am working right now on a project for a construction business. The project is a Web application build on React with javascript and typescript, using mongoDb, designed to simplify the process of creating machined parts in the construction industry. I'm happy to share about the project without disclosing to much information
